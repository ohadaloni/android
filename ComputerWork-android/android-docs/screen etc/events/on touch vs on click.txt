I noticed with TableRow that
ontouch returning true causes onclick to never get called

ontouch is called multiple times with separate Motion.action as described in
   http://www.anddev.org/android-2d-3d-graphics-opengl-problems-f55/ontouch-is-called-twice-aftr-single-click-on-image-in-canvas-t48427.html

	just check the value coming back from event.getAction() and compare with the constants for the MotionEvent class:

So I ended up using onClick for now, as it is called exactly once without having to check the event.
