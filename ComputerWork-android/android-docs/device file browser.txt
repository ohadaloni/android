A SQLite database is just a file. You can take that file, move it around,
and even copy it to another system (for example, from your phone
to your workstation), and it will work fine. Android stores the file in
the /data/data/packagename/databases directory (see Figure 9.1, on the
next page).

You can use the adb command or the

File Explorer view in
Eclipse (Window > Show View > Other... > Android > File Explorer) to
view, move, or delete it.
