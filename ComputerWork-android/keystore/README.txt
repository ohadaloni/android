if I want to debug and publish with the same key,I will need to change the passwords of the keystore from ohad152to the eclipse know password which is 'android'.This seems to be a security hole:the published applications have awell advertized password for the keystore.to change password, according to:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2889238/java-keystore-change-passwordskeytool -storepasswd -keystore /path/to/keystoreEnter keystore password:  changeitNew keystore password:  new-passwordRe-enter new keystore password:  new-passwordkeystore.txt is the name of the file I chose for the keystore.my.keystore is a copy.all passwords are the same: ohad152(there is an alias called nekko, also with this ohad152 password).Sudoku.apk is the final and signed application file that was created with theprocess of exporting and signing the application from eclipse.to see the certificate:keytool -list -keystore keystore.txtPath:C:\Program Files\PC Connectivity Solution\;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\Program Files\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools;C:\Program Files\Android\android-sdk\tools;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bincmd.exe:F:cd \disksOnKey\Computer Work\android\keystoreF:\disksOnKey\Computer Work\android\keystore>keytool -list -keystore keystore.txtEnter keystore password:Keystore type: JKSKeystore provider: SUNYour keystore contains 1 entrynekko, Apr 28, 2011, PrivateKeyEntry,Certificate fingerprint (MD5): CD:2B:09:F4:68:AC:B9:16:54:D2:39:3D:92:61:D6:5CIn the youTube video he add -alias ... to the command:keytool -list -alias nekko -keystore keystore.txtGoogle maps API key:0A3OP0pX5ZL2o6h7RubTlGFnfqI0jqbtvArFFBAThis output was given at signupGoogle Code Home > Google Maps API > Google Maps API SignupThank you for signing up for an Android Maps API key!Your key is:0A3OP0pX5ZL2o6h7RubTlGFnfqI0jqbtvArFFBAThis key is good for all apps signed with your certificate whose fingerprint is:CD:2B:09:F4:68:AC:B9:16:54:D2:39:3D:92:61:D6:5CHere is an example xml layout to get you started on your way to mapping glory:              <com.google.android.maps.MapView                 android:layout_width="fill_parent"                 android:layout_height="fill_parent"                 android:apiKey="0A3OP0pX5ZL2o6h7RubTlGFnfqI0jqbtvArFFBA"                 />            Check out the API documentation for more information.for development, the password for the debug key is 'android' :Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600](C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.C:\Documents and Settings\mich>cd .androidC:\Documents and Settings\mich\.android>keytool -list -keystore debug.keystoreEnter keystore password:Keystore type: JKSKeystore provider: SUNYour keystore contains 1 entryandroiddebugkey, Mar 31, 2011, PrivateKeyEntry,Certificate fingerprint (MD5): 89:CC:F5:2C:CD:D7:6F:FB:2A:CE:80:EE:DB:AF:6E:7FC:\Documents and Settings\mich\.android>which generated a map api key:0A3OP0pX5ZL23lxbww7vuu-8ZV6eFSlL0SAlpugIt seems that to publish a mapview application I will need toswap the apikey in the mapview widget xml (main.xml?) with the real one as part of the publishing process.
